                <h3>Artifact 1: Volunteer Work in Egypt - Teaching English and Engaging with Children</h3>
                <p>This artifact showcases my volunteer experience in Egypt, where I dedicated my time and efforts to teaching English to children and engaging them in fun and educational activities.</p>
                <div class="context">
                    <p>During my time in Egypt, I had the incredible opportunity to volunteer at a local community center that provided educational and recreational programs for underprivileged children. One of my primary roles was to assist in the English language classes, where I developed and implemented interactive lesson plans tailored to the students' diverse learning needs and language proficiency levels.</p>
                    <p>In addition to teaching English, I also organized and facilitated various activities and games aimed at fostering a fun and engaging learning environment. These activities not only helped reinforce the language concepts taught in class but also promoted teamwork, creativity, and social skills among the children.</p>
                    <p>Through this volunteer experience, I gained valuable insights into cross-cultural communication and the challenges faced in underprivileged communities. It allowed me to develop patience, adaptability, and the ability to connect with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Moreover, witnessing the children's enthusiasm and progress reinforced my passion for education and community service.</p>

                <h3>Artifact 2: Research Project</h3>
                <p>This artifact is a research project I conducted on data visualization techniques for large datasets. It demonstrates my ability to analyze complex data, design effective visualizations, and communicate findings clearly.</p>
                <div class="context">
                    <p>This research project was completed as part of my Data Visualization course at the University of Maryland. The goal was to explore different visualization techniques and evaluate their effectiveness in presenting large and complex datasets. I chose to analyze a dataset on global carbon emissions and developed interactive visualizations using D3.js to help users better understand the data and identify patterns and trends.</p>
                    <p>Through this project, I gained valuable experience in data analysis, visualization design, and effective communication of insights. It showcases my skills in data processing, visualization tool selection, and creating user-friendly and visually appealing data representations.</p>

                <h3>Artifact 3: Web Development Project</h3>
                <p>This artifact is a web application I developed as part of a course project. It showcases my skills in front-end and back-end web development, as well as my ability to design user-friendly interfaces.</p>
                <div class="context">
                    <p>This web development project was completed for my Web Programming course at the University of Maryland. The objective was to design and build a full-stack web application using modern web technologies. I chose to create an online book review platform where users can browse, review, and discuss books.</p>
                    <p>Throughout this project, I gained experience in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end development using Node.js and MongoDB. I also focused on creating an intuitive and responsive user interface, incorporating features like user authentication, book search functionality, and community discussions.</p>

                <h3>Artifact 4: UX Design Case Study</h3>
                <p>This artifact is a case study documenting my process for designing a mobile app focused on improving user experience. It highlights my skills in user research, wireframing, prototyping, and iterative design.</p>
                <div class="context">
                    <p>This UX design case study was a personal project where I aimed to create a mobile app to help students organize their schedules and stay on top of their academic and extracurricular commitments. I conducted user research through surveys and interviews to understand the pain points and needs of college students.</p>
                    <p>Based on the research findings, I developed wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes, which I then tested with potential users. Incorporating their feedback, I refined the design and created high-fidelity prototypes using tools like Figma. This iterative design process allowed me to create a user-friendly and visually appealing app that addresses the specific needs of the target audience.</p>
